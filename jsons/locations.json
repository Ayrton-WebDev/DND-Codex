Its people are hardy and diverse, thriving in cities built on cliffs, volcanic plains, and icy northern harbors. Ulgrath’s history is steeped in ancient wars and forgotten empires, and its current politics are shaped by the balance between trade, magic, and survival.",

          "description": "Encircled by sweeping oval walls, the capital city’s form resembles a colossal eye gazing upward from the earth, its gates flanked by the homes of hunters, farmers, and laborers who sustain its heart. At the core lies the High Top District, a perfect circle within the oval, where the Animus Pillars rise — three spires of flawless symmetry, equal in height and breadth, their shadows stretching over every street. Within these towers dwell the royals, the highest nobles, and the most esteemed mages, sustained by endless deliveries and ancient privilege, rarely descending into the city below; to the people, the Pillars are both marvel and omen, a reminder that power here gazes outward but seldom bends down.",

Here, raw recruits are tempered into soldiers, their oaths echoing beneath sun-scorched skies. The town thrives as a vital crossroads — a final bastion of water and respite for those bound toward the blazing heart of Emberholst, or the long, perilous road north to Frostport. Around it, a ring of humble villages feeds its forges and fills its stores, their toil sustaining the Empire’s armies. To dwell in Saltcare is to live in the shadow of war, where every hammer’s strike and every grain of grain speaks to the endless hunger of empire.",

The city thrives on the wealth of its surrounding forests, sending timber across Ulgrath and distant continents, and shaping the mighty ships that sustain the Empire’s reach. Yet it is not commerce alone that marks Rustview; the largest military garrison outside the capital calls the city home, its disciplined ranks ever vigilant against the northern threats, and its towers and battlements echo with the clang of steel and the whispered legends of warriors who have kept the Empire’s heart safe for generations.",

Though the elemental fell millennia past, the air still shimmers with lingering heat, a testament to its titanic fury, and only the dragonborn, hardened by flame, call this place home. From its mighty forges—renowned across the Empire and beyond—flow weapons and armor of unparalleled quality, while its skilled artisans shape glass and steel alike. Supplied with provisions from the western lands, Emberholst thrives as both a crucible of craft and a bastion of enduring heat, a city where fire itself has become both guardian and legacy.",

Flanked by towering mountains guarding the lone road inland, the town relies on both natural fortifications and a dedicated, if occasionally lax, military presence to protect its vital commerce. Merchants and mariners from across the Empire traverse Frostport’s docks, bringing goods and stories from distant lands, while shadows of a growing criminal network whisper in the alleys, a reminder that even a city of trade and bounty cannot escape the hunger of ambition.",

Here, wealth rules unchecked—nobles control the land, the trade, and the very laws that others must obey, and any who challenge them find ruin swiftly following. Despite its proximity to the cursed isle, Ebonvale thrives as a bustling fishing hub, exporting rare and exotic aquatic ingredients to distant corners of Ulgrath, even as sea monsters relentlessly stalk its waters. Its people, though not all affluent, are tempered by hardship and danger, forged into resolute and fierce fighters who navigate both the greed of their rulers and the perils of the deep.",

Fargate is a city tempered by vigilance, its streets filled with soldiers and watchmen, maintaining order amid the lingering tensions between north and south, and standing as both a bastion and a gateway to the mysterious riches buried deep in Ulgrath’s stone.",

Though its mages are said to hold the balance of the war with the South in their hands, they would prefer to focus on their studies, and welcome those from across the world to aid in their various researches.",
