        "text": "When the veil tore anew, Sharizeth descended in full malice. No mortal army followed her banners — instead, she birthed horrors that embodied deceit and dread. Cloakers and creeping things slithered into caverns and shadows, striking unseen, while towns awoke to find themselves strangled in webs. Those who lived long enough saw eggs split and spill forth the next brood of her monstrous armies, each generation more cruel than the last. Tales spread of Sharizeth herself striding through the ruins — her form half-drow, half-spider, a grotesque weaving of grace and terror. None know if this was her chosen guise, a self-proclaimed evolution, or a punishment wrought by Ultharion himself. Whatever the truth, her visage became a symbol of dread: beauty devoured by shadow, perfection corrupted into chaos."
