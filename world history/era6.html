            <h1>The Second Heavenly War (2,650–2,750 years)</h1>
            <p>The Dread Lords returned, and with them came an age of devastation the world had scarcely seen. Takairim, once bound by the guidance of 
                gods and mortals alike, became a battlefield of ambition, fury, and terror. The Feywild, scarred by centuries of war, drew its veils tight 
                and closed itself off, fearing the fate that had befallen Faramirr.</p>
            <p>The Celestial Court, weakened yet unyielding, called forth new children to aid in the coming struggle. These races, born of divine purpose, 
                were crafted to bolster mortals and stand against the coming chaos. Corellon, seeing what mortal magic was capable of, limited their abilities. 
                He and Ioun took knowledge of the most powerful spells and sealed it in her library on another plane. He then placed a ban on all spells above 
                9th level.</p>
            <p>Mortals, emboldened by the gifts of magic and left largely to their own devices, became ambitious and daring. Cities of flesh and shadow rose, 
                grotesque abominations crafted by mortal hands yet guided by whispers of the betrayer gods. From their hubris, the Abyss was shaped — a realm of 
                endless torment, born of mortal desire for power and immortality, yet influenced by the lingering corruption of the Dread Lords.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the war raged across Takairim for a millennium, reshaping mountains, rivers, and forests in its wake. Entire cities fell; the 
                impossible cities created in the Age of Sorcery became tombs for those who lived there. With no safe way to escape the falling cities, most did not 
                survive.</p>
            <p>At last, the Celestial Court, bound by desperation and sorrow, cast the final, unparalleled Holy Blockade. This spell drew upon their own divine 
                essence and the twisted power of the Dread Lords alike, sealing all divine beings from the world. Takairim was left to its children alone; portals 
                between planes were severed, leaving only a few lingering scars through which creatures might pass. The Blockade was absolute — unbroken, unyielding, 
                and stronger than any mortal or god could undo.</p>
            <p>The spell that bound the Dread Lords carried unforeseen consequences. As the Holy Blockade sealed away divine and infernal powers, fragments of 
                elemental energy bled back into Takairim. From storm and stone, flame and frost, great beings emerged — the first of the Giants. Though born of the 
                raw elements themselves, they were not mindless forces like the Primordials before them. The Giants were willful, proud, and powerful, destined to 
                carve their own place in the mortal world.</p>
            <p>Mortals, driven by survival, hunted the remaining planar creatures. Dragons, mighty and terrible, fought and vanished, their last sighting burned into legend. 
                Their existence on other planes has been confirmed.</p>
            <p>The Second Heavenly War ended with silence, a world emptied of gods, yet alive with the consequences of mortal ambition, divine fury, and lingering shadows. 
                The echoes of the war shaped the age to come, leaving scars both visible and hidden, and a caution to all who might forget the price of power.</p>
