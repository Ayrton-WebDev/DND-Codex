            <h1>The First Heavenly War (2,300–2,450 years)</h1>
            <p>The peace of the Age of Harmony shattered when the Dread Lords rose in open defiance. What had been whispers and shadows became war — 
                a war among the gods themselves. Many perished, their names lost to memory, their deeds erased from mortal recollection.</p>
            <p>From the chaos, the Hells were forged: vast realms of torment and fire, each bound to the Dread Lords’ will. From these infernal 
                crucibles arose creatures of nightmare, forged to serve, hunt, and terrify. Chromatic dragons were born from the chaos of the elemental planes, 
                mighty beings of scales and hunger, driven to gather precious stones and materials — a design meant to weaken mortals. In response, the Metallic 
                dragons arose, champions of balance. Among these dragons, two immensely powerful beings emerged: Bahamut and Tiamat, joining the gods in name and might.</p>
            <p>The Dread Lords corrupted mortal races, twisting them to create goblins, bugbears, and other demi-human races. The Celestial Court and the mortal armies were 
                overwhelmed by numbers and power. The gods were often unable to aid their allies, threatened by the presence of a Dread Lord upon the battlefield.</p>
            <p>In their desperation, mortals were granted magic, a gift from Mythra, who sought to empower them against the devastation. Yet this boon was fleeting; Mythra fell, 
                and her stewardship passed to Corellon, who guided mortals in the new ways of arcane and divine arts. These new magics gave mortals the strength to withstand the 
                hordes and stand against the creations of the betrayer gods.</p>
            <p>The war saw the betrayal and destruction of Faramirr, once a bastion of dwarven craft. The betrayer gods sought to sever mortals from the materials and knowledge 
                that might allow them to resist. The mountains and mines of Faramirr were sundered, and from its ruins the Shadowfell arose, a realm of shadow and loss.</p>
            <p>Yet this ultimately turned against the Dread Lords. Shaken by the loss of their homeland, the dwarves fled into human lands. Their combined cities and armies 
                could now match the numbers the Dread Lords sent, and the magic bestowed by Mythra gave them the upper hand.</p>
            <p>At last, the gods, weary and mourning, cast the Holy Blockade: a spell of immense power that sealed the Dread Lords beyond the planes, cutting them off from 
                mortal and divine alike. They then helped push as many beings from the chaotic elemental planes and the Hells back beyond their portals and sealed them away.</p>
            <p>Takairim breathed again, though forever changed — the scars of war remained, and the shadow of the Dread Lords lingered, even as their influence was bound.</p>
