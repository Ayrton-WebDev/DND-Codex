            <h1>The Age of Harmony (2,000–2,300 years)</h1>
            <p>With the Primordials cast down, Takairim entered an age of true peace. 
                Gods and mortals had walked together since the First Dawn, but now their bond was tempered in war and sealed in trust. 
                The gods, immortal and mighty, looked upon mortals not as fragile children, but as equals — worthy of love, faith, and friendship.</p>
            <p>At last, the world was free to flourish. The veils between planes lay open; travellers passed freely between Takairim, the Feywild, and Faramirr. 
                Knowledge was shared without envy, and wonders beyond counting were wrought</p>
            <p>The elves grew forests into shining halls, the dwarves carved mountains into kingdoms, and humankind built cities upon the rivers and seas. 
                Trade and craft flourished, and peace bound the races together. The gods themselves walked among their children, offering counsel, blessing, and guidance.</p>
            <p>The gods created more children to share their worlds. The halflings and gnomes joined the human and elven realms. These beings, never having suffered the horrors of war, 
                brought a joy and positivity that was scarce among the other races.</p>
            <p>Yet not all among the divine were content. In the hearts of some, jealousy took root. They looked upon mortals not as partners, but as playthings. 
                Where their brethren fostered harmony, these gods sought dominion. Their whispers turned from creation to corruption.</p>
            <p>At first the changes were subtle — beasts twisted into crueller forms, shadows that clung too long at dusk. But soon monsters roamed the land: scaled horrors born of venom and fire, 
                beasts whose hunger no feast could sate, and creatures that defied both nature and reason. Mortals who once walked without fear now looked to the dark with dread.</p>
            <p>Thus the seeds of discord were sown. Though the Age of Harmony endured for more than two thousand years, its end was foreshadowed in every monster’s cry and the long nights that accompanied them. For mortals, none could say why these gods had turned, only that they had.</p>
            <p>The Dread Lords had formed.</p>
