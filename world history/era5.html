            <h1>The Age of Sorcery (2,450–2,650 years)</h1>
            <p>The Celestial Court, weary and diminished from the First Heavenly War, turned inward. Many of the gods remained in recovery, their strength spent in 
                the battles with the Primordials and the Dread Lords, and what power they could muster was devoted to maintaining the Holy Blockade. Mortals, left 
                largely to their own devices, began to stretch the bounds of their gifts.</p>
            <p>Magic, once a tool granted in measured doses, grew in power and scope. Mortals constructed cities that defied reason, monuments that reached into the 
                clouds and sank into the earth. They learned to shun the guidance of the gods, believing themselves the architects of their own destiny. 
                This arrogance, a subtle inheritance of the Dread Lords’ corruption, crept through mortal hearts.</p>
            <p>In their pursuit of power and prolonged life, mortals twisted the gifts of Mythra. Nature’s balance was broken, a wound too great even for the God of 
                Death to heal. From this hubris, immortality was forged in darkness: vampires stalked the night, and liches rose from their tombs, born not of godly 
                design but of mortal folly and selfishness.</p>
            <p>Amidst this rise of mortal dominion, a coalition known as the Arcane Syndicate emerged. Gathering power and followers, they commanded undead servants 
                and bent forbidden magics to their will. Through a mass ritual sacrifice, they shattered a fragment of the Holy Blockade, weakening the wards that had 
                long kept the Dread Lords at bay. The shadow that had been bound so long surged back into the world, and with it came the first tremors of a new age of 
                war and destruction.</p>
            <p>Thus the Age of Sorcery burned bright and perilous, a time when mortal ambition and divine absence collided — a crucible in which the Dread Lords returned, 
                and the world teetered once more on the brink of destruction.</p>
