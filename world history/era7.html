            <h1>The Age of Ascendance (Current, year 663AB [After Blockade])</h1>
            <p>The Age of Ascendance began when the Celestial Court sealed themselves away, 
                ending the Second Heavenly War. The Holy Blockade was cast, severing the gods from Takairim, 
                but the war did not end at once — for a few years, mortal armies still fought against the lingering 
                hosts of the Dread Lords until, at last, the shadows were broken and victory claimed.
                In the wake of that final battle, many gods withdrew entirely, creating planes shaped from 
                their own essence — sanctuaries apart from the world. Corellon claimed the Feywild as his dominion. 
                Asmodeus and Tiamat were cast into the Hells, bound to its infernal prisons. The mortal world was 
                left standing, scarred but free — and for the first time, wholly its own.</p>

            <h3 class="title">The Giant Wars (c. 0–120 AB)</h4>
            <p>The earliest century of this age was marred by the rise of the Giants. Born, it is said, from 
                elemental energies that bled back into Takairim when the Blockade was sealed, they sought dominion 
                over mortals by might and birthright. The Giant Wars lasted more than a century, their great 
                fortresses shaking the earth itself. United mortal armies eventually shattered their strength, 
                driving the giants into exile and ruin. Even so, their remnants endure — in ruins that crown 
                mountains, in bloodlines whispered of with awe and dread, and in the dreams of those who would 
                see their empires rise again.</p>
            <h3 class="title">The Rise of Vecna (c. 150 AB)</h3>
            <p>Not long after, another shadow rose. Vecna, the Whispered One, once a mortal and then a lich, 
                ascended to godhood and carved an empire of dread. His dominion spread across much of Takairim, 
                his power unchecked. Scholars agree that mortals themselves performed a desperate ritual to cast 
                him beyond the Blockade, binding him where even gods are trapped. Yet though his empire fell, 
                whispers of his name still linger — and some claim his voice can still be heard, promising secrets 
                to those willing to listen.</p>
            <h3 class="title">The Wars of Tresylda (c. 250–350 AB)</h3>
            <p>Roughly a century later, Takairim faced Tresylda, the lich queen of the Arcane Syndicate. In pursuit 
                of dominion, she orchestrated a mass ritual sacrifice, tearing open the balance of life and death. 
                From this atrocity, the Arcane Plague was born — a sickness that spread undeath like fire. Those 
                afflicted swelled her armies, until whole cities were emptied of life and raised in chains of shadow. 
                For nearly a century, war raged against her and her legions. Though Tresylda was eventually defeated, 
                accounts differ as to how: some say she was struck down in battle, others that she was unmade by a 
                great ritual, and a few that betrayal from within broke her. What is certain is that the Arcane 
                Plague was forced deep into the Underdark, where it festers still. Rare cases surface even today, 
                though most dismiss them as remnants, not portents.</p>
            <h3 class="title">The Rise and Fall of Kingdoms (c. 350–600 AB)</h3>
            <p>With Tresylda’s fall, the Age of Ascendance entered a long era of ambition. Kingdoms rose and fell 
                across every people of Takairim, some enduring centuries, others collapsing within a generation. 
                The elves, divided by the choices of their kin, split their paths. Most remained in Takairim, 
                intermingling with other races and shaping mortal cities with their artistry and knowledge. Yet a 
                smaller number withdrew into the Feywild, sealing themselves off and declaring themselves above the 
                folly of mortals. Across Takairim, alliances shifted, empires rose, and crowns were broken. 
                The ruins of these kingdoms still scatter the land, reminders of mortal pride and fleeting power.</p>
            <h3 class="title">A Living Age (600 AB – Present)</h3>
            <p>The Age of Ascendance is not yet finished. It is a living age, written still in the choices of rulers, 
                the whispers of ambition, and the scars of war. Some call it the Age of Hubris, saying that mortals who 
                claim “ascendance” merely walk the same path that doomed their forebears. What is certain is this: 
                though the gods are gone, their echoes — and the shadows they left behind — still shape the world.</p>
