            <h1>The Elemental Cataclysm (300–400 years)</h1>
            <p>From the shadows of creation rose the Primordials — vast beings of fire, storm, stone, and sea. 
                They had ruled Takairim before the gods first set foot upon it, and they raged to find their dominion usurped.</p>
            <p>Their awakening shattered the balance. Skies split with endless tempests, mountains cracked, and the seas swallowed whole kingdoms. 
                Where the gods had sown harmony, the Primordials wrought ruin.</p>
            <p>The gods, still weary from their long passage, could not stand against such fury. With their mortal children, they fled across the veils to the Feywild and 
                Faramirr, cutting off the bridges to Takairim. There, in refuge, they prepared for war. Elves bound the forests to their cause, dwarves summoned stone and steel, 
                and humankind rallied behind both. For centuries the gods guided them, gifting courage, strength, and will — until mortals themselves stood as weapons of hope.</p>
            <p>When the Primordials struck again, mortals and gods met them in defiance. Though the cost was terrible, victories came. The gods learned to gather the essence of  
                fallen titans, and from that terrible power they forged the elemental planes — prisons of fire, storm, earth, and sea. Into chosen mortals they breathed this same power, 
                birthing heroes mighty enough to wound the unassailable.</p>
            <p>At last, the gods turned the Primordials’ own strength against them, banishing their forms into the newborn planes. There their bodies dissolved into raw element, 
                scattering into the myriad beings that dwell there still.</p>
            <p>So ended the Cataclysm. Takairim was left scarred but unbroken. Yet for many centuries mortals lived in the shadow of their fallen foes, fearing that the 
                Primordials were not destroyed, but only dreaming… waiting to rise once more.</p>
