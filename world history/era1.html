            <h1>The First Dawn (600-800 years)</h1>
            <p>When the gods first arrived in Takairim, they found only chaos: storms that tore the skies, seas that raged without end, and mountains that bled fire. Yet where others would see desolation, the gods beheld a canvas.</p>
            <p>With but a thought, they tamed the wilds. Forests rose, rivers carved their courses, and life blossomed across the land. In their great design, they mirrored Takairim into two reflections: the Feywild, where nature’s spirit dwelled, and Faramirr, rich with the bones of the earth. Thus were born three planes, each seeded with life.</p>
            <p>The first mortals rose upon these worlds. Humanity thrived in Takairim, mastering the seas and the hunt. The elves, dwelling in the Feywild, bent nature to their will and shared their secrets freely. The dwarves, in Faramirr, drew riches from the stone and shaped wonders from the deep. Trade and kinship bound the peoples together, for in these days travel between planes was effortless.</p>
            <p>Though the gods walked beside mortals, they gave aid sparingly, for they were weary from their long passage. Still, the world prospered.</p>
            <p>Yet beneath this newfound order, the old powers stirred. Storms raged anew, mountains roared, and the seas rose in fury. These were the first tremors of the Primordials — colossal beings of raw element who had once ruled Takairim… and now hungered to reclaim it.</p>
